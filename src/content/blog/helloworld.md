I'm Hermar López and this is my first entry in my own personal portfolio.

Since I started in the world of web development, I have always enjoyed showing my projects to the rest of my colleagues. Initially, we would gather in a university classroom and showcase our projects on a single machine, explaining how we built them. At that time, we did not have enough knowledge to know what a repository or version control was, but the desire to learn and share with others was there.

I have always loved showing others what I am working on and explaining what situations I can solve with a certain technology or simply showing the practices of the project I was working on. Over time, many of the projects I worked on were lost in random folders that can no longer be recovered. This is where my desire to put all my projects online in one place and show all my work to anyone who wants to see it comes from. It first started with a small repository and then led to the portfolio you are currently viewing.

I wanted something simple and intuitive, not overly saturated with elements, and with the help of Astro, I was able to achieve what I wanted. I am aware that there are portfolios that are much more stylish and with an interface that has elements in constant motion, but those solutions are not to my liking. If you were to ask me what a functional website is, I would probably take the complete definition of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" target="_BLANK">motherfuckingwebsite</a>. A good website is not one that has a ton of styles and animations everywhere, but one that is well optimized, has a good user experience, and the information you are looking for is easy to find.

I am really excited about all the things I have yet to develop, all the developers and teams I have yet to meet. I know it will be something I will treasure with great affection.
