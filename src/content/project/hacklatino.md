<b>General description</b>
<br>
The present project focused on creating a website with the main purpose of giving visibility to HackLatino Academy. The client requested that the free courses be displayed on the page, but that access be redirected to their mobile application. Additionally, several representative images were designed to be incorporated into the site, and advertising copies were created to promote the client's services.

The goal of this project was to fully satisfy the client's needs, with a focus on presenting HackLatino Academy's free courses, while creating an attractive visual aesthetic and generating effective advertising content to attract site users. It is important to note that quality standards were met and a satisfactory user experience was guaranteed.

In conclusion, this project was developed successfully and within the established time frame, demonstrating my ability to tackle challenges and meet client expectations.

<b>Project Design</b>
<br>
This particular project consists of a total of 8 sections located in the navigation bar (navbar), which include: Home, About Us, Courses, Podcast, Contact, Blog, App on PlayStore, and App on Appstore. Each of these sections has a distinct customization and redirects to specific pages within the website.

This detailed and meticulous approach to the design and functionality of the navbar sections ensures a pleasant and consistent user experience at all times. Additionally, the different customizations of each section add a touch of originality and style to the website.

It is important to note that each section has a unique link that directs the user to the corresponding page, which is fundamental to maintaining the coherence and effectiveness of navigation on the website.
